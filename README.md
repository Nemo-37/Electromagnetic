An electromagnet is a device that creates a magnetic field when an electric current passes through it. They are widely used by people in everyday life. The use of electromagnets in everyday life.

The use of electromagnets in everyday life:
With the advent of electromagnetic new products, household items have become more convenient. Electromagnets have become so widespread that it is difficult to name a field of technology where they would not be used in one form or another. They are contained in many household appliances - electric shavers, tape recorders, televisions, etc. Communication technology devices - telephony, telegraphy and radio are unthinkable without their use.

Electromagnets are an integral part of electrical machines, many industrial automation devices, control and protection equipment for various electrical installations. A growing field of application for electromagnets is medical equipment. Finally, giant electromagnets are used to accelerate elementary particles in synchrophasotrons.

The use of electromagnets in medicine:
Electromagnets made of iron-boron-neodymium alloy are widely used in medicine. Why are there only magnetic resonance tomographs, in which powerful magnets are built in large sizes. With their help, you can examine the human body and detect health problems, glaucoma, measure eye and blood pressure. In microsurgery and surgery, special devices are used to extract
orogenous bodies from human tissues (steel, iron fragments).

Classification of electromagnets:
Electromagnets are very diverse in design, which differ in their characteristics and parameters, so the classification facilitates the study of the processes occurring during their operation.

Depending on the method of creating a magnetic flux and the nature of the acting magnetizing force, electromagnets are divided into three groups: neutral DC electromagnets, polarized DC electromagnets and AC electromagnets.

Electromagnet device
At the same time, with all the variety of electromagnets encountered in practice, they consist of the main parts of the same purpose. These include a coil with a magnetizing winding located on it (there may be several coils and several windings), the fixed part of the magnetic circuit made of ferromagnetic material (yoke and core) and the moving part of the magnetic circuit (armature).

Depending on the location of the armature relative to the rest of the electromagnet, electromagnets with an external attracting armature, electromagnets with a retractable armature and electromagnets with an external transversely moving armature are distinguished.
